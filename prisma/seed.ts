As the early Christians were able to take the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome and to the nations, using the same methods that the Roman emperors worked for their military and political purposes, all of us are striving to bring the gospel to all people through the Internet and other digital technologies. We have two main reasons for doing so. The first is the principle of missions that go into all the world. Today, 2/3 of the world's population has access to the Internet. Even in developing countries, such as Ethiopia, many are joining this technology at an unprecedented pace. And with information like Google, millions of people every day ask different questions about God, spiritual life, happiness, and love. After all, if the Internet is one of the ways to go all over the world, what else could it be? The second is just as good as the opportunities digital technology has brought to our day, evil is just as easy to spread among humans too. In the midst of this, racism and hate speech are currently testing the nation, and pornography has become a challenge that has disrupted many marriages and families, and this problem has been a challenge for the church. So, what would it be if it is not digital technology, where our battlefield to save a lost generation?",

Within this initiative, we have identified four major domains, each strategically crafted to address key aspects of leadership development and spiritual growth. Firstly, our emphasis on Leadership Development underscores our commitment to equipping professionals and executives with the essential skills, knowledge, and character traits necessary to lead with integrity and Kingdom-mindedness. Through tailored training programs, mentorship opportunities, and immersive leadership retreats, we empower leaders to navigate the complexities of their roles with wisdom and grace. Furthermore, Spiritual Formation lies at the core of our mission, as we recognize the importance of nurturing the spiritual well-being of leaders. Providing a range of resources such as devotional materials, Bible studies, and prayer groups, we support individuals in deepening their relationship with God and living out their faith authentically in their workplaces. Additionally, our spiritual retreats, conferences, and seminars foster a sense of community and accountability among leaders. In the realm of Marketplace Ministry, we encourage professionals and executives to view their careers as platforms for Kingdom impact. By championing initiatives like workplace chaplaincy programs, ethical business practices seminars, and corporate prayer networks, we mobilize leaders to integrate their faith into their professional lives and become agents of transformation in their workplaces. Beyond their workplaces, our Community Engagement domain empowers professionals and executives to serve and impact their communities positively. Whether through volunteering with local charities, mentoring youth, or participating in community development projects, leaders have the opportunity to demonstrate Christ-like love and compassion, bearing witness to the transformative power of the Gospel in their communities.",

Our mission is to unite with fellow believers within the body of Christ and empower the faithful among the 25 million Christians to reach out to the rest of the population with the message of Jesus Christ, striving to establish movements for church multiplication (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; John 3:16). Aligned with the purpose, mission, and values of Great Commission Ministry Ethiopia, a ministry under Campus Crusade for Christ International, we envision a world where every individual has access to a vibrant church or faith community, regardless of their location. GCM fosters inclusivity by embracing a diverse spectrum of churches and missional communities, each reflecting a variety of expressions, backgrounds, models, sizes, and shapes. Despite this diversity, these entities are united by a shared commitment to several core principles. These include upholding the authority of the Bible and acknowledging the Lordship of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the Great Commission, and spreading the gospel of Jesus through both word and deed. Moreover, they affirm the unity and paramountcy of the kingdom of God, recognizing the One Church as the Bride of Christ. In their endeavors, they prioritize the development and application of contextually relevant models and strategies that remain deeply rooted in the Word of God. We prioritize the establishment of intergenerational coaching relationships, the development of new leaders, the mobilization of financial resources, and the multiplication of churches at the local level. This indicator underscores our commitment to building self-sustaining and resilient communities of faith, capable of perpetuating their mission and ministry over time. In summary, these Key Movement Indicators serve as benchmarks for assessing the progress and impact of our mission efforts.

It is led by a team of five individuals: Kibru Tadesse (Geographic Expansion Director), Desta Samuel (Leadership Development), Hanna Habtemariam (Geographic Expansion Admin Assistant), Getachew Mohammed (Leadership Member from Area Clusters), and Sebsibe Elias (also a Leadership Member from Area Clusters). The team convened its inaugural meeting from August 22-24 at the Pacific Hotel to discuss and plan their initiatives. In this regard, the team embarked on journeys to Hawassa, Bahirdar, Hosanna, and Arbaminch to engage directly with area cluster leaders and staff members. During these visits, various activities were conducted, including budget transfers among regional offices, staff transfer processes, addressing requests and listening to reports and challenges from the team, fostering fellowship, meeting with area advisory committees and Church fellowships, conducting assessments of the areas, and other related tasks. Furthermore, the team personally traveled to oversee and facilitate the official inauguration of the new offices in Arbaminch and Hosanna. This effort involved mobilizing national leaders such as the national director, student-led strategy team leader, church-led strategy team leader, and two media team members, along with four members of the Geographic Expansion Team leadership. GET organizes monthly online meetings with area cluster leaders to stay updated, address requests, provide guidance, foster fellowship, share experiences, and exchange prayer requests. In addition, GET has been assisting local area cluster offices by sending letters from the national GCME office as required, delivering prayer requests from branch offices to prayer leaders on office fasting and prayer days, and providing support for assignments assigned by the national director.

        fullDescription:
          "At Jesus Film Project, we are more than just filmmakers‚Äîwe are passionate storytellers driven by the desire to share the transformative message of Jesus Christ with the world. Our mission is rooted in the belief that every individual, regardless of language or location, deserves to encounter the life-changing love and forgiveness found in Jesus. With the support of our dedicated partners and by God's grace, our Christian films have been translated into over 2,000 languages, breaking down barriers of language and literacy to ensure accessibility for all. However, our vision extends beyond filmmaking. Guided by faith, we are committed to reaching every corner of the globe, especially those regions with limited access to the gospel. As the world evolves, so do our methods‚Äîwe innovate, adapt, and harness new technologies to effectively share the timeless story of Jesus Christ with a diverse and ever-changing audience. Film is not just an ancillary element to the mission of the Jesus Film Project¬Æ‚Äîit's the very essence of our identity. We firmly believe that film possesses a unique potency to communicate the gospel message to individuals across all corners of the globe, regardless of their cultural or linguistic backgrounds. Michael Allen, the Director of Narrative Production for the Jesus Film Project, articulates the profound significance of storytelling in Jesus' ministry: 'Jesus, in his ministry, astoundingly employed storytelling as a primary medium to impart kingdom truths. This choice was not arbitrary; rather, it resonated deeply with the cultural context of the time. In an era where oral tradition was the predominant means of transmitting heritage, Jesus astutely recognized the power of narrative to engage and enlighten his audience. This prompts us to ponder: why film? The answer lies in the cultural ubiquity of film and media as modern-day conduits of ideas. By harnessing these mediums, we can effectively convey the timeless truth of the gospel to contemporary audiences.' Indeed, storytelling holds a universal allure. Whether one resides in the bustling metropolis of Dublin or amidst the serene expanse of the Serengeti, narratives possess an inherent ability to captivate, inspire, and provoke introspection. Moreover, the medium of film, with its amalgamation of visual, thematic, and auditory elements, serves to magnify the impact of these stories, rendering them more immersive and emotionally resonant. The JESUS film stands as a testament to the transformative potential of cinematic storytelling. As the most widely viewed and translated film in history, it has reached billions worldwide, catalyzing over 600 million decisions to embrace the teachings of Jesus‚Äîa testament to the efficacy of film as a vehicle for spiritual enlightenment. Since its inception, the Jesus Film Project has been committed to transcending linguistic barriers by facilitating the translation of its films into diverse languages. This endeavor has not only democratized access to the gospel message but has also engendered profound encounters with Jesus among linguistically diverse communities. Across continents and cultures, the impact of film on spiritual awakening is palpable. From the radiant smiles in Burma to the tear-streaked faces in Kenya and Brazil, the universality of human emotion serves as a testament to the transcendent power of cinematic storytelling. The efficacy of film as a communication tool stems from several key factors: 1. Overcoming the limitations of literacy: With a significant portion of the global population lacking literacy skills, film transcends this barrier by offering a visually and audibly accessible medium for conveying complex narratives. 2. Bridging cultural divides: While written texts may be susceptible to misinterpretation across cultural boundaries, the visual and auditory richness of film fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation of diverse cultural contexts. 3. Cultivating empathy and perspective-taking: By immersing viewers in multifaceted narratives, film prompts introspection and challenges entrenched worldviews, fostering empathy and cross-cultural understanding. 4. Facilitating personal transformation: The immersive nature of film fosters emotional resonance, prompting viewers to confront their beliefs and values, ultimately leading to profound spiritual and personal growth. As witnessed on a global scale, film has the power to evoke immediate and enduring responses to the gospel message, making it an indispensable tool for evangelism and spiritual outreach. Looking to the future, the Jesus Film Project remains committed to harnessing the transformative potential of film to share the gospel with audiences worldwide. With ongoing initiatives to develop innovative cinematic experiences and expand access to gospel-centered content through digital platforms, we are poised to continue making an indelible impact on hearts and minds around the world. For those seeking to engage with the gospel message through film, the Jesus Film Project app offers a comprehensive library of feature-length and short films in multiple languages, providing a convenient and accessible resource for spiritual exploration and growth.",

      fullBio: `Senay Kumelachew is a young, sociable, and technophilic leader who finds joy in reading, walking, and spending time with people. As a committed digital strategist, Senay devotes his life to equipping churches and ministries to embrace technology for Kingdom work.

          His passion for digital missions began back in high school, fueled by his frustration over the Church's underuse of social media and digital tools. Everything changed when, as a freshman university student, he encountered the digital strategy team at Great Commission Ministry Ethiopia. From that moment, Senay joined as a volunteer mobilizer and online missionary.

          He pioneered digital strategy initiatives in his campus fellowship and local church, training peers and launching outreach efforts. As an associate staff, he traveled from campus to campus and church to church, equipping others to become digital missionaries.

          To fully embrace this calling, Senay became a full-time staff member in September 2018. Today, he serves as the Digital Mission Team Leader at GCME's Digital Strategy Office, leading projects that empower the Church to thrive in the digital age.`,

      problem: `Many individuals and families are suffering silently‚Äîdealing with grief, shame, addiction, trauma, and depression‚Äîoften without anyone to talk to or support them.

  Cultural stigma discourages open conversations about emotional pain. As a result, people isolate themselves and miss out on healing and restoration through community, understanding, and the love of Christ.

  Current media rarely gives space to raw, redemptive stories that bring both truth and hope.`,
      solution: `GEMENAYE is a powerful television program that invites people to share their stories of struggle and healing, highlighting how love, faith, and authentic relationships make a difference.

  Each episode features a real-life testimony, expert commentary, and practical biblical reflections. The program creates a safe space for viewers to see themselves in the stories and find encouragement to open up, seek help, and connect with community support.

  The show will air weekly on major Christian TV channels and be available online with resources for follow-up support.`,
