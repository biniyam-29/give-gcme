As a committed digital strategist, Senay devotes his life to equipping churches and ministries to embrace technology for Kingdom work. His passion for digital missions began back in high school, fueled by his frustration over the Church's underuse of social media and digital tools. Everything changed when, as a freshman university student, he encountered the digital strategy team at Great Commission Ministry Ethiopia. From that moment, Senay joined as a volunteer mobilizer and online missionary. He pioneered digital strategy initiatives in his campus fellowship and local church, training peers and launching outreach efforts. As an associate staff, he traveled from campus to campus and church to church, equipping others to become digital missionaries. To fully embrace this calling, Senay became a full-time staff member in September 2018. Today, he serves as the Digital Mission Team Leader at GCME's Digital Strategy Office, leading projects that empower the Church to thrive in the digital age.",
